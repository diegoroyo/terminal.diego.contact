<p>For a given pair of images, optical flow is a 2D vector field that represents the apparent motion of each pixel between the two images (e.g. "this object has moved three pixels up and two pixels to the right").<br><br>
I built flowvid is a toolkit for common operations that deal with optical flow during my research on this field. It comes with many visualization and data manipulation presets.<br></p>
